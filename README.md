# BDN_barcode

See requirements.txt for all dependencies

This is a piece of software to generate as many tickets + barcodes as desired, given a background template and some tweaking to the barcode position.

Barcode styles are stored in `style_options.py`, and the code is run from the command line as `python3 test_barcode.py`.
